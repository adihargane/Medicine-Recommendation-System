# Medicine Recommend System

Most people tend to live a long and healthy life, but people are busy in their
day-to-day life and it is not possible for everyone to visit doctors for minor
symptoms of a disease. Many people do not know about medicines and to visit a 
doctor and consult for minor symptoms for medicines is a time-consuming
process. AI and machine learning like emerging technology can help us to 
create a recommended system that will prescribe medicine and this system can
accurately predict a medicine to use. In this paper proposes the medicine 
recommendation system which will predict disease and medicine according to
symptoms entered by patients/users.
